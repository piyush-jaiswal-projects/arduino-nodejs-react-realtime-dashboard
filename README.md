# arduino-nodejs-react-realtime-dashboard
This repository contains the code for a real-time dashboard that displays data collected from an Arduino connected to a Node.js backend. The backend receives data from the Arduino via the USB port and uses Socket.io to emit the data in real-time to a React front-end. The React front-end then displays the data on a dashboard, updating in real-time as new data is received. This repository includes the code for the Node.js backend, the Arduino sketch, and the React front-end. With this code, you can quickly build a real-time dashboard for monitoring and displaying data collected from an Arduino using Node.js and React.
